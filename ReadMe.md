# Character level language model - Dinosaurus Island

This is a great lecture! I'm recommending "Sequence Models" at Coursera given by DeepLearning.AI to anyone who would 
like to learn NLP!

This project is prepared with the functions from week 1.  
The explanations in the homework is below:

"To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level language model to generate new names. 
Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns

- Store text data for processing using an RNN
- Build a character-level text generation model using an RNN
- Sample novel sequences in an RNN
- Explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in RNNs
- Apply gradient clipping as a solution for exploding gradients"
